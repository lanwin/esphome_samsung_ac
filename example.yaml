# This example provides a basic configuration and description based on the M5STACK components
# For further configuration you should visit the ESPHome docs https://esphome.io
# Every line starting with a # can be removed.

## BASIC CONFIGURATION
esphome:
  name: samsung_ac
  friendly_name: Climate

# Select chipset and board configuration - in this case M5STACK
esp32:
  board: m5stack-atom

# [Optional] - Create web interface where you can control the AC from your web browser (without Home Assistant)
web_server:
  port: 80

# Enable logging
logger:
  logs:
    component: ERROR # Remove the "Your component takes to long to respond warning"

# Enable native API for communication with Home Assistant, this can be removed if you do not plan to use it with Home Assistant
api:

# Enable OTA firmware update, you will be able to upload the firmware over WiFi without connecting the device by cables
ota:
  platform: esphome

# Setup your WiFi password
wifi:
  ssid: "My WiFi Name" # !!!CHANGE ME!!!
  password: "My WiFi Password" # !!!CHANGE ME!!!

captive_portal:

# Specify pins used by the board to comunicate with RS485 board - in this case M5STACK
uart:
  tx_pin: GPIO19   # Use GPIO26 for ATOM Tail485 
  rx_pin: GPIO22   # Use GPIO32 for ATOM Tail485
  # For older devices it could also be 2400. But you should start with 9600.
  baud_rate: 9600
  parity: EVEN

## SAMSUNG AC CONFIGURATION

# Import custom component from GitHub
external_components:
  - source: github://lanwin/esphome_samsung_ac@main # Use @stable if you want a more stable experience, but note a lot of this example code breaks.
    components: [samsung_ac]

# Configuration of AC component
samsung_ac:

  # For NonNASA devices the following option can be enabled to prevent the device from sleeping when idle. This allows
  # values like internal and external temperature to continue to be tracked when the device isn't in use.
  non_nasa_keepalive: true
  
  # When enabled (set to true), this option will log the messages associated with undefined codes on the device. This is useful for debugging and identifying any unexpected or unknown codes that the device may receive during operation.
  debug_log_undefined_messages: false
  
  # When enabled (set to true), this option logs messages associated with defined codes on the device. This helps in monitoring the behavior of the device by recording the activity related to known, expected codes.
  debug_log_messages: false

  # Capabilities configure the features that all devices of your AC system have (all parts of this section are optional). 
  # All capabilities are off by default, you need to enable only those your devices have.
  # You can override or configure them also on a per-device basis (look below for that).
  capabilities: 
    vertical_swing: true
    horizontal_swing: true
    # Presets define special AC modes like Windfree, Eco, and so on. 
    # The following modes are available: sleep, quiet, fast, longreach, windfree, eco.
    presets: 
      # Short version - a quick and simple way to enable presets.
      quiet: true
      # Long version - allows customization, including localized names and control over enabling the presets.
      fast:
        name: "Fast cooling"
        enabled: true

  devices:
    # Skip everything below on the first run! Wait a minute, watch your ESPHome logs until you see the "Discovered devices:" section and you see some addresses:
    # For NASA devices it looks like this (with 1 outdoor device and 4 indoor devices): 
    #   Outdoor: 10.00.00
    #   Indoor:  20.00.00, 20.00.01, 20.00.02, 20.00.03
    # For NonNASA devices it looks like this (with 2 indoor devices): 
    #   Indoor:  00, 01
    # You need these addresses for the the sections below. If you see only a "-" then you should visit the troubleshooting section in the readme. 

    # Repeat everything below for each indoor device address you see in your logs
    - address: "20.00.00" # Indoor device address 
      # Each property below is optional (climate, room_temperature etc.) - you can delete those which you dont need.
      # For the names we suggest to choose a combination of room name and the thing it controls. 

      # Configures/overrides the capabilites for this devices. 
      # Look above for all options.
      capabilities:
        horizontal_swing: false # This device have no h swing.

      climate:
        name: "Kitchen climate"

      # The controls directly below are all included in the climate control. Its adviced to only add the climate control and skip the extra controls.

      #Add automatic_cleaning mode for Samsung AC NASA
            #- Added the "automatic_cleaning" feature to the Samsung AC integration.
            #- This mode ensures hygienic drying of all moisture in the indoor unit after the cooling process is completed.
      automatic_cleaning:
        name: "Kitchen automatic clean"

      # If your AC sits near or inside the ceiling, the reported room temperature is often a little bit heigher then whats

      # This sensor captures and monitors specific error codes returned by the HVAC system.
      # When an error occurs, the sensor detects the error code and updates its value accordingly.
      # Additionally, by using the blueprint available at https://github.com/omerfaruk-aran/esphome_samsung_ac_blueprint,
      # you can automatically send detailed error messages to your mobile devices based on the captured error codes.
