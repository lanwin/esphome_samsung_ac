## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not publicly disclose the issue** before it has been patched and reviewed. Public disclosure can put users at risk.

2. **Create a new issue** on the project's GitHub repository under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/lanwin/esphome_samsung_hvac_bus/issues), with the `Security` label. Please include the following details in your report:
    - Affected version(s)
    - A detailed description of the issue
    - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
    - Your proposed mitigation or fix (if available)

3. Once the report is received, we will:
    - Acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
    - Work with you to understand the issue and validate the vulnerability.
    - Provide you with an expected timeline for a fix and coordinate an appropriate disclosure timeline.

4. We aim to resolve all security issues as quickly as possible and will notify you once a patch is available. You will be credited for your report unless you wish to remain anonymous.

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lanwin/esphome_samsung_hvac_bus/releases)
- [Project Change Log](https://github.com/lanwin/esphome_samsung_hvac_bus/CHANGELOG.md)
